# üó∫Ô∏è Zentient Framework: Collaborative Implementation Roadmap

Welcome to the Zentient Framework!  
This document is designed for everyone interested in collaborating on, integrating with, or adopting Zentient.Abstractions 3.0.1 and its ecosystem. Whether you‚Äôre considering using Zentient in your projects or contributing to its development, this roadmap outlines our architectural vision, project structure, and ways to get involved.

## What is Zentient Framework?

**Zentient** is a modular, enterprise-ready framework for .NET, built to help teams deliver robust, scalable systems with clarity and confidence.  
Our design is based on four core pillars:

- **Definition-Centric Architecture:** Components are self-describing, encouraging strong contracts and discoverability.
- **Universal Envelope Pattern:** Standardized result and error handling across all layers.
- **Fluent Dependency Injection:** Flexible, testable service registration and resolution.
- **Built-in Observability:** Integrated logging, metrics, diagnostics, and tracing.

---

## üì¶ Package Structure & Modular Design

Zentient is organized into several focused packages, all decoupled via a core set of abstractions.  
**Core Foundation:**  
- **Package:** `Zentient.Abstractions (3.0.1)`
- **Target Frameworks:** .NET 6.0‚Äì9.0

**Key Namespaces & Contracts:**

| Namespace                                | Purpose                             | Key Interfaces                      |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Zentient.Abstractions.Common              | Core contracts, type IDs            | IIdentifiable, ITypeDefinition      |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Results             | Results, envelopes                  | IResult<T>, IEnvelope<TCode,TError> |
| Zentient.Abstractions.DependencyInjection | DI registration/resolution          | IServiceRegistry, IContainerBuilder |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Configuration       | Configuration                       | IConfiguration, ITypedConfiguration<T> |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Validation          | Validation                          | IValidator<T>, IValidationResult    |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Diagnostics         | Health checks, diagnostics          | IDiagnosticCheck<T>, IDiagnosticResult |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Observability       | Logging, metrics, tracing           | ILogger<T>, IMeter, ITracer<T>      |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Caching             | Caching                             | ICache<T>, ICacheKey<T>             |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Messaging           | CQRS, messaging                     | ICommand, IEvent, IQuery<T>         |
| Zentient.Abstractions.Policies            | Resilience, retry, circuit-breaker  | IPolicy<T>, IRetryable              |

**Planned Implementation Packages:**
- **Zentient.Core:** Foundational implementations
- **Zentient.DependencyInjection:** Advanced DI APIs
- **Zentient.Messaging:** CQRS and event sourcing patterns
- **Zentient.Diagnostics:** Health checks and diagnostics
- **Zentient.Caching:** Advanced distributed caching
- **Zentient.Policies:** Resilience (retry, circuit breaker, etc.)

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

Our roadmap is designed for incremental, collaborative progress. Each phase is an opportunity to get involved.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1‚Äì2)
- Set up solution structure, install Zentient.Abstractions
- Implement core contracts, envelope/result pattern, basic DI, validation, and configuration
- **Outcome:** A working skeleton to build on or integrate with

### Phase 2: Service Architecture (Weeks 3‚Äì5)
- Domain/service contract design, repository abstractions, caching layer
- **Outcome:** Complete service/business logic layers, extensible for new domains

### Phase 3: Messaging & CQRS (Weeks 6‚Äì8)
- Establish command/query/event infrastructure, event sourcing basics
- **Outcome:** CQRS, event-driven foundation, audit logging

### Phase 4: Resilience & Observability (Weeks 9‚Äì11)
- Apply retry/circuit breaker/timeout, diagnostics, metrics, health checks, tracing
- **Outcome:** Production-grade observability and resilience

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 12‚Äì14)
- Distributed caching, configuration hot-reload, security and audit integration
- **Outcome:** Advanced caching, dynamic config, security, and readiness for production

## üîß Technical Guidelines

**Development Environment:**  
- Visual Studio 2022 17.8+ or JetBrains Rider 2023.3+  
- .NET SDK 8.0.300+  
- Docker, Git (conventional commits)

**Project Structure:**
```
Solution.Root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core/            # Domain, Application, Infrastructure
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Api/             # Controllers, Middleware, Config
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared/          # Contracts, Constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/               # Unit, Integration, Performance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                # API, Architecture, Deployment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/               # Scripts, Analyzers
```

**Coding Standards:**
- Interfaces: Prefix with `I` (e.g., `IUserService`)
- Use domain-specific codes for envelopes
- Definitions end with `Definition`
- Prefer attribute-based or fluent DI registration

**Recommended Patterns:**
```csharp
// Attribute-based registration
[ServiceRegistration(ServiceLifetime.Scoped)]
public class OrderService : IOrderService { /* ... */ }

// Fluent registration
services.AddZentientServices(builder =>
{
    builder
        .RegisterScoped<IUserService, UserService>()
        .RegisterSingleton<ICacheService, RedisCacheService>()
        .AddValidation()
        .AddDiagnostics();
});
```
