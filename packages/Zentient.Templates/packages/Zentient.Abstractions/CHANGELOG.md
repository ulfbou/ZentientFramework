## üì¶ [3.0.0] ‚Äî 2025-01-XX

üöÄ **Zentient Framework 3.0 - Four-Pillar Architecture & Enhanced Developer Experience**

> This major release introduces the refined four-pillar architecture that establishes Zentient as a comprehensive foundation for modern .NET applications. Building upon the solid abstractions of v2.x, this version focuses on exceptional developer experience, architectural clarity, and production-ready capabilities.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - MASSIVE BREAKING CHANGES**: This is a **complete rewrite** of the library requiring full migration from 2.x. See `MIGRATION_GUIDE_2.x_to_3.0.md` for essential migration instructions.

---

### üí• Breaking Changes ‚Äî Complete Architectural Rewrite

‚ö†Ô∏è **THIS IS NOT A COMPATIBLE UPGRADE** - Every 2.x implementation will require updates:

| Breaking Change | 2.x | 3.0.0 | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Namespace Structure** | `Zentient.Abstractions` (flat) | `Zentient.Abstractions.*` (hierarchical) | All using statements must change |
| **File Organization** | 21 files in `src/` root | 200+ files in organized directories | File references must be updated |
| **Interface Design** | Simple interfaces | Generic definition-based architecture | Interface implementations need type parameters |
| **Type System** | Basic types | Rich type-safe abstractions | Type constraints and definitions required |

### üìö Migration Resources

* **`MIGRATION_GUIDE_2.x_to_3.0.md`** - **ESSENTIAL**: Complete migration guide with examples
* **Global Usings**: `GlobalUsings.cs` helps reduce namespace update effort  
* **Type Aliases**: `ZentientAbstractions.cs` provides convenient shortcuts
* **Compatibility**: Some simple interfaces preserved for easier migration

---

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Evolution ‚Äî Four-Pillar Design

Zentient Framework 3.0 is built on four foundational pillars:

1. **Definition-Centric Core** - Type-safe, strongly-typed definitions for all domain concepts
2. **Universal Envelope** - Consistent, protocol-agnostic containers for all operations
3. **Fluent DI & Application Builder** - Intuitive service registration and application composition
4. **Built-in Observability** - Comprehensive diagnostics, health checks, and monitoring capabilities

### ‚ú® Added ‚Äî Developer Experience & Framework Integration

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **`IZentient`** | Unified, non-generic entry point providing access to all framework systems through clean generic methods |
| **Global Using Directives** | Comprehensive global usings in `GlobalUsings.cs` for enhanced development experience |
| **Convenience Namespaces** | Type aliases in `ZentientAbstractions.cs` for improved discoverability and shorter syntax |
| **Enhanced Container Builder** | Async-capable `BuildZentientAsync()` method for production-ready application composition |
| **Source Link Integration** | Full source debugging support with GitHub integration for enhanced debugging experience |

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Enhanced ‚Äî Project & Documentation

| Component | Improvements |
|---|---|
| **Multi-target Support** | Enhanced .NET 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 support with optimized configurations |
| **NuGet Package Metadata** | Professional package presentation with comprehensive metadata and Source Link |
| **XML Documentation** | Enhanced documentation generation with proper symbol support |
| **README.md** | Completely rewritten with four-pillar architecture explanation and comprehensive examples |
| **Code Analysis** | Enhanced analyzer integration with Zentient-specific rulesets |

### üîß Technical Improvements

> üîñ **Zentient Framework 3.0** establishes the definitive foundation for building consistent, discoverable, and maintainable .NET applications with exceptional developer experience.

---

## üì¶ [2.0.1] ‚Äî 2025-07-17 (Hotfix)

üí• **Immediate Architectural Correction**

> This patch release addresses an architectural oversight in the newly released v2.0.0.
> While technically a breaking change, it is being released as a patch to immediately correct
> the intended placement of a core abstraction prior to widespread adoption of v2.0.0.
> Future breaking changes will strictly adhere to major version bumps.

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed ‚Äî Core Contracts & Refinements

* **`ErrorCategory`**:
    * **Breaking Change**: Relocated from `Zentient.Results` namespace to `Zentient.Abstractions` namespace.
        * **Impact**: Consumers must update their `using Zentient.Results;` statement to `using Zentient.Abstractions;` for `ErrorCategory`.
        * **Rationale**: `ErrorCategory` is a fundamental, protocol-agnostic primitive intended for the core abstraction layer, not a specific result implementation. Its correct placement in `Zentient.Abstractions` aligns with the framework's design principles.

---

### üìò Documentation

* No changes to existing wiki pages required, as they already reflect the intended namespace for `ErrorCategory`.

---

> üîñ This release ensures the foundational `ErrorCategory` abstraction is correctly placed within `Zentient.Abstractions`, solidifying the framework's core design.

---

## üì¶ [2.0.0] ‚Äî 2025-07-17

üí• **Major Overhaul & API Refinement**

> This version introduces a significantly expanded and refined set of core abstractions, enhancing flexibility, consistency, and support for advanced patterns like hierarchical contexts, structured errors, and composable policies. It includes breaking changes to core envelope contracts to improve protocol-agnosticism.

---

### ‚ú® Added ‚Äî Core Contracts & Factories

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed ‚Äî Core Contracts & Refinements

* **`IContext`**:
    * Added `Id`, `Parent`, `CorrelationId` properties for enhanced traceability and hierarchy.
    * `Metadata` property changed from nullable (`IMetadata?`) to non-nullable (`IMetadata`).
    * Introduced `CreateChild`, `WithMetadata`, `WithType`, and `Merge` methods for immutable context manipulation.
* **`IEnvelope`**:
