## üì¶ [2.0.0] ‚Äî 2025-07-17

üí• **Major Overhaul & API Refinement**

### ‚ú® Added ‚Äî Core Contracts & Factories

| Interface           | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ICode`             | Universal, protocol-agnostic code for operation outcomes with symbolic name and optional numeric value. |
| `ICodeFactory`      | Factory for creating `ICode` instances.                                                                 |

| `IErrorInfo`        | Detailed, immutable information about an error, including category, code, message, and nested errors.   |
| `IErrorInfoFactory` | Factory for creating `IErrorInfo` instances, including from exceptions.                                 |
| `IEnvelopeFactory`  | Factory for creating various `IEnvelope` types (generic, headered, streamable).                         |
| `IHeaderedEnvelope` | Base contract for envelopes supporting arbitrary key-value headers (protocol-agnostic).                 |
| `IHeaderedEnvelope<TValue>` | Strongly-typed headered envelope for carrying operation result payloads.                        |
| `IMetadataFactory`  | Factory for creating `IMetadata` instances.                                                             |
| `IPolicyFactory`    | Factory for creating common policy instances (retry, circuit breaker, fallback).                        |
| `IStreamableEnvelope<TStream>` | Base contract for envelopes whose payload can be streamed.                                      |
| `IStreamableEnvelope<TStream, TValue>` | Strongly-typed streamable envelope containing both a stream payload and a value.        |

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed ‚Äî Core Contracts & Refinements

* **`IContext`**:
    * Added `Id`, `Parent`, `CorrelationId` properties for enhanced traceability and hierarchy.
    * `Metadata` property changed from nullable (`IMetadata?`) to non-nullable (`IMetadata`).
    * Introduced `CreateChild`, `WithMetadata`, `WithType`, and `Merge` methods for immutable context manipulation.
* **`IEnvelope`**:
    * `Code` property type changed from `IEndpointCode?` to the more general `ICode?`.
    * `Messages` property changed from nullable (`IReadOnlyCollection<string>?`) to non-nullable (`IReadOnlyCollection<string>`).
    * `Metadata` property changed from nullable (`IMetadata?`) to non-nullable (`IMetadata`).
    * Added new `Errors` property (`IReadOnlyCollection<IErrorInfo>`) for structured error reporting.
* **`IEnvelopeFactory`**:
    * Removed `isSuccess` parameter from `CreateEnvelope` methods, as success is now implicitly determined by the absence of errors.
* **`IPolicy<T>`**:
    * Renamed the `With` method to `CombineWith` for clearer semantic meaning when chaining policies.
    * Added `Fallback` method for defining fallback execution paths.
* **`ErrorCategory`**:
    * Relocated from `Zentient.Results` to `Zentient.Abstractions` for broader applicability.
    * Updated XML documentation to remove specific references to `ErrorInfo` properties, maintaining abstraction.
* **`IEnvelope<out TValue>`**:
    * Renamed from `IEnvelope2<out TValue>` to simplify the interface name.

### üóëÔ∏è Removed ‚Äî Deprecated Contracts

* `IEndpointCode`: Replaced by the more general and flexible `ICode` interface.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Build & CI/CD

* **Build Properties (`Directory.Build.props`)**:
    * Enabled documentation file generation conditionally for non-test projects.
    * Removed redundant analyzer and StyleCop configurations.
    * Cleaned up unnecessary comments and simplified `SolutionDir` definition.
* **Package Targets (`Directory.Pack.targets`)**:
    * Removed duplicate package metadata properties, centralizing configuration.
* **Project File (`Zentient.Abstractions.csproj`)**:
    * Configured inclusion of `README.md` in the NuGet package.
    * Corrected the path for `AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile`.
* **Strong-Name Key (`Zentient.snk`)**: Added the strong-name key file to the repository.
* **CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)**:
    * Implemented a comprehensive GitHub Actions pipeline for automated build, pack, and release.
    * Includes semantic versioning via GitVersion, artifact management, and automated publishing to NuGet.org and GitHub Releases.
    * Features robust release notes extraction from `CHANGELOG.md`.
